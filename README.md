## Overview
A transfer learning-based approach to detect the disease in cotton plant by analyzing the visual interpretation of the leaf of several cotton crops. For this project, I have  created a web application using Flask,Tensorflow-Keras in which we have used transfer learning in which we are using XCEPTION Architecture. This web application classify images of the diseased cotton leaf,fresh cotton leaf,diseased cotton plant and fresh cotton plant.

## Motivation
Now a day’s financial impact of agriculture is increase day by day with economic growth of our country, still agriculture is one wide sectors and that is play very important role for our county. While keeping track of diseases in plants with the help of specialists can be very costly in agriculture region. There is a need for a system which can automatically detect the diseases as it can bring revolution in monitoring large fields of crop and then plant leaves can be taken cure as soon as possible after detection of disease. There are so many diseases that affect for cotton and many more crop that effect many filed of agriculture. So those identify this disease and how to recover from it. This objective will satisfy though our application which is helps for do prediction of cotton disease.

## Dataset
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/janmejaybhoi/cotton-disease-dataset. 
In this dataset there are three folders like train , test and validation folder . In this dataset there are 4 category like diseased cotton leaf , diseased cotton plant , fresh cotton leaf , fresh cotton plant to predict from.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to use the API
Just run ‘aap.py’ file in spyder or you can run it using anaconda prompt. Then you will get localhost address like ‘http://127.0.0.1:5000/‘ enter it in any browser in your system then enjoy it.
